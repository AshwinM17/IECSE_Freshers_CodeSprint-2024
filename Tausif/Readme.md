Statement

As part of an internship at a struggling supermarket, you are tasked with an innovative marketing challenge. With the store nearing closure, you brainstorm creative ways to attract customers. One promising idea is to hold a lottery giveaway, featuring bundles of items that are nearing their expiration dates. Your goal is to calculate the total cost of all possible combinations of these items to highlight the potential value customers could win.

Imagine the excitement as customers flock to the store, enticed by the chance to win these valuable bundles. To prepare for the promotion, you need to determine the total sum of the costs for every possible combination of the giveaway items.
Examples

Input:

•	prices: 1,2,3

Output:

•	24

Explanation:

The possible combinations and their sums are:
1.	1 = 1
2.	2 = 2
3.	3 = 3
4.	1+2 = 3
5.	1+3 = 4
6.	2+3 = 5
7.	1+2+3 = 6
Total sum = 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 24

Input:

•	prices: 5,10,155, 10, 155,10,15

Output:
•	80

Explanation:

The possible combinations and their sums are:
1.	5 = 5
2.	10 = 10
3.	15 = 15
4.	5+10 = 15
5.	5+15 = 20
6.	10+15 = 25
7.	5+10+15 = 30
Total sum = 5 + 10 + 15 + 15 + 20 + 25 + 30 = 120
