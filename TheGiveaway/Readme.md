Statement

You are tasked with a marketing challenge at a struggling supermarket. The store is near closure, and you need to attract more customers. One idea is to hold a lottery giveaway featuring items nearing their expiration dates. Your goal is to calculate the total value customers could win. How would you approach this task?

Imagine the excitement as customers flock to the store, enticed by the chance to win these valuable bundles. To prepare for the promotion, you need to ensure that the store's already ruined finances are not ruined further. Will you be able to save the store, or put the final nail in it's coffin
