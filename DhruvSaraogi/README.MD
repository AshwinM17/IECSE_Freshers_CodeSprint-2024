# STATEMENT

-----

In a bustling metropolis, a renowned art museum was preparing for its grand reopening. The museum's curators had meticulously cataloged their extensive collection of paintings, sculptures, and artifacts. However, during the preparations, they discovered that two identical pieces of art had been mistakenly acquired, but the records for these pieces were incomplete or inaccurate.

As the museum's detective, your task is to find these duplicate pieces using only the limited information available in the records. You must examine the records carefully, comparing the artist's name, the title of the piece, and the year of creation.

# YOUR GOAL

------

- Return an array containing the titles or descriptions of the duplicate pieces, based solely on the information available in the records. 
- These pieces, likely due to errors in acquisition or labeling, are identical and should not be part of the museum's collection.
- If no duplicates are found display a message "No duplicates found."

## Input Format:
-------
- First line is the number of creations present
- In the second line there are 3 1D Array of name of artist(String),title of their painting(String) and year they were created(int). 
- Remember all three have to match for it to be considered as a duplicate.

## Output Format:
-----
- number of the duplicated titles(int)
