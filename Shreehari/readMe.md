# Statement:
Imagine you're Nathan Drake, standing before the door to an ancient treasure chamber deep within the ruins of a forgotten civilization. This isn't just any ordinary doorâ€”it's a massive, intricately designed stone gate, sealed with a riddle inscribed in ancient symbols.

As you decipher the symbols, you realize it's not a typical puzzle, but a mathematical challenge left behind by the ancients. You have in your hand a set of ancient numbers, carved into stones, and the door mechanism only unlocks when you arrange these numbers to form the<b> largest possible value</b>.

The mechanism is delicate, and you know that the wrong combination will trigger traps or keep the treasure forever out of reach. You must solve this code and input the largest number possible by arranging these stones. The ancient text hints at something:<b> the numbers are large enough that they must be treated as a string, not a typical number</b>.


# Input format:
The input should consist of a  list of non-negative integers nums.<br>

# Output Format:
The output should return the string that contains the largest number possible.<br>

# Constraints:
-`` 1 <= nums.length <= 100``

-``0 <= nums[i] <= 109``

# Sample:
## Example 1:

Input:``nums = [10,2]``

Output:``"210"``

## Example 2:

Input: ``nums = [3,30,34,5,9]``

Output:``"9534330"``
