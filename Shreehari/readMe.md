# Statement:
You are Nathan Drake, standing before the door to an ancient treasure chamber, deep within the ruins of a forgotten civilization. The massive stone gate is sealed with a riddle, inscribed in cryptic symbols. As you study them, you realize this is not just any puzzle—it's a mathematical challenge.

In your hand are ancient stones, each engraved with a number. To unlock the door, you must place them in the correct arrangement. There are <b>n</b> stones before you, each with a distinct value, and only the right sequence will reveal the key to the treasure. The solution is not as simple as it first seems, and the power of the stones is hidden in their mysterious alignment.

The markings speak of “aligning the stones in the greatest order” to unlock the gate. The true nature of the mechanism is elusive, and the wrong combination will keep the treasure forever sealed. The answer lies in the ancient code, but its meaning remains just out of reach, waiting for you to uncover the secret to unlocking the chamber. Solve it, or the treasure may be lost forever.

The meaning feels elusive, almost incomprehensible, but the solution lies in deciphering this ancient algorithm—a code that must form the<b> largest number </b>from the arrangement of these stones. Solve it, or the treasure may be lost forever.


# Input format:
The first line consists of a number n which is the number of distinct stones.The next n integers are the unique values in each of them.<br>

# Output Format:
The output should return the string that contains the largest number possible.<br>

# Constraints:
-`` 1 <= n <= 100``

-``0 <= nums[i] <= 999``

# Sample:
## Example 1:
Input:
``n = 2
nums=[10,2]``

Output:
``"210"``

## Example 2:

Input: 
``n=5
nums = [3,30,34,5,9]``

Output:``"9534330"``
